# AWS Notes App
This project is a simple serverless notes application built with AWS. It uses API Gateway, Cognito for authentication, Lambda functions (Python), and DynamoDB for data storage. Infrastructure is managed using Terraform. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes securely via authenticated API endpoints.
